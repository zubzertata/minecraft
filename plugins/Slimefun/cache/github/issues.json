Description\n\nSome days ago someone reported that they can't craft an [ElectricSpawner](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/ElectricSpawners).\r\n\r\nBoomer and I checked on this and found out that having extra NBT Tags in this case we will focused on `CustomModelData`, made the item not accepted by the recipe.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a Core Slimefun issue that is why I'm posting it here rather on [ElectricSpawners Issue](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/ElectricSpawners/issues)\r\n\r\nThe item that affects with issue that we tested:\r\n- Reinforced Spawners\r\n- All vanilla item (I think

Open `item-models.yml`\r\n2. Add a value under `REINFORCED_SPAWNER`. (I'll use 1)\r\n3. Start the server\r\n4. Obtain yourself a spawner (In the video I'll be using vanilla generated spawner, spawned spawner, and soul jars)\r\n5. Repair the spawner\r\n6. Try to craft it to their ElectricSpawner type\r\n7.

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nThis purpose of this PR is to provide a way for specific SlimefunItems to provide a summary of their contents. This would be used when Transport Slots and/or #getContents simply doesn't cut the mustard! \r\nExamples of blocks that could implement this interface would be Barrels to expose their full content as opposed to just the one stack in the output slot, Multi-page inventories to return all held items not just the currently selected one and the likes of DankPacks and likely many more possible applications I've not thought of just yet.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n- New Interface extending ItemAttribute.\r\n- A method `getStoredItems` that will return `Map<ItemStack, Integer>` used to tell calling methods what the SlimefunItems currently contains.\r\n- A method `withdrawItem` that takes a template ItemStack and a requested amount and returns how many items were successfully removed for the calling method to then handle. (I have swapped between ItemStack, ItemStack Array and int a few times and this one felt the most useful in the end - very open to input as to the return type for this method)\r\n- A method `depositItemStacks` that takes an ItemStack array for the SlimefunItem to try to consume into the storage. Currently returns nothing as the calling method can just look at the array after calling to check what's left - open to having the return the modified array instead?)\r\n- A method `depositItemStack` that just calls `depositItemStacks`. Return type may change based on feedback to the above.\r\n- A method `contains` to return a boolean if the SlimefunItem contains a matching ItemStack within itself.\r\n\r\nSee Sefiraat/Networks@3e36b9f in which I changed my Network Shells (v e r y r o u g h l y) to use this interface and had the network read the items in a much neater way than I was doing previously.

Items that vary by lore or another meta aspect are being 'merged' with items that happen to match on ID but are, otherwise, distinct. See issue #3379.

Description\r\nThis PR is twofold: on one hand, it transforms all the damage dealt by lightnings to damage dealt by the caster; on the other, it adds the ability to enable StormStaff usage in non PVP areas (as any damage is now automatically nullified, having the EntityDamageByEntityEvent been \"transformed\" to attribute the damage to the caster).\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n- Substituted any EntityDamageByEntityEvent caused by StormStaff lightnings with ones with the caster as damager\r\n- Added an ItemSetting to allow enabling usage of Storm Staves in non PVP area (damage to players is

This pull request registers a SlimefunItem for the ItemStack with minimal behavioral changes.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n- Create ``FilledKnowledgeFlask``, which is a ``SlimefunItem`` that implements ``NotConfigurable`` and is hidden in the Slimefun guide.\r\n- Create a new ``RecipeType``: ``RecipeType.INTERACT``, which signifies that the item is obtained by interacting with the ingredient.\r\n- Create and register a ``FilledKnowledgeFlask`` instance in ``SlimefunItemSetup``.\r\n\r\nThe overall effects of these changes are:\r\n- When clicking a filled flask of knowledge in the Slimefun guide, it will now display the method of obtaining a filled flask, which is interacting with an empty flask of knowledge. \r\n- ``FILLED_FLASK_OF_KNOWLEDGE`` will be added to the ``SlimefunRegistry``.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n``SlimefunItem.getById(\"FILLED_FLASK_OF_KNOWLEDGE\")`` no longer returns ``null``.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

Description\r\nCurrently there is an issue with the Book Binder.\r\nIf you combine 2 books of the same level and the resulting level will go above the set limit (either vanilla or custom) the books will combine into one and keep their current level.\r\n\r\nThis fix makes it so that if a `Fortune III` gets combined with another `Fortune III`, it will not be combined into another `Fortune III` (granted there is no custom limit)\r\nThis has no effect for books with multiple enchantments as both books have the same level\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n- Fix books being consumed and returning their current value\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are

Install Slimefun\r\n2. Disable Stone Chunks from `items.yml`\r\n3. Look at the guide, the recipe just got shifted\r\n4. Try using the compressor just using 1 coal\r\n5. It will output 8 coal\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nThe recipe should not be shifted.\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sgOPYilkLis\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Side by

The main problem I need to fix, is actually fact that players are able to enchant mmoitems witch blocked use in enchanting tables or anvils in sf autoenchanters. in. My items are blocked against enchanting but in sf you can simply bypass it. I know there's a way to add blocked lore. But what about old items without that lore? A lot of of my players using items without this lore.\r\n\r\nSo what I need to add ?\r\nEasily check stats from mmoitem and if it has blocked using in crafting, enchanting.., it won't be possible to upgrade this item. This will be probably better than using lores, because it will apply to all items no matter how old those items are.\r\n\r\nLet me know, if it is possible, thanks and have a good day!\r\n\r\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nCreate an mmoitem and block it's interaction in enchanting tables/anvils.\r\nAdd this item to slimefun autoenchanter.\r\nYou can add this item there.\r\n\r\n### üí° Expected

üìî Introduction\r\nOver the last few months and years you all have often requested for us to be more open in regards to upcoming changes.\r\nSo we decided its time to finally release a proper roadmap.\r\nNote here that this roadmap will never be complete and final, we may add or change some goals from time to time and we will refrain from setting a release date for things until absolutely certain.\r\n\r\nThis simply serves as a rough guide for you to see what changes you can be excited about.\r\nMany of those changes will likely be of technical nature though, so they may not be as exciting or intesting at first.\r\n\r\nAlso, we aren't actively looking for pull requests towards these goals unless explicitly requested.\r\nIf you wish to make a pull request, choose any open issue or approved suggestion and you are more than welcome :heart:\r\nThese changes however are mainly targeted towards the core team.\r\n\r\n## ‚≠ê Upcoming changes\r\nSome of these milestones will have a date assigned to them.\r\nBut the majority of milestones are still to far away to even have a date ready here.\r\nThose are marked as *TBD* (to be decided).\r\n\r\n| Symbol | Type of change |\r\n| :---: | :------- |\r\n| üîß | Technical change / API |\r\n| üéà | New Features |\r\n| üí° | Performance improvements |\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Older changes</summary>\r\n\r\n### üîß ~~(September 3rd - 6th 2021) API relocation~~ - **DONE**\r\nThe first upcoming change is a major relocation of some of our classes to unify some packages, get rid of old classpaths and to follow the general conventions. You can read more about this here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3139\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### üîß (Q1 2022) Inventory system rewrite\r\nNext up is a rewrite for our inventory-system. The API is very rusty and aged. We don't have an ETA yet, perhaps closely after or along with the aforementioned API relocation.\r\nThe new system will be much more flexible and easier to use for developers.\r\n\r\n### üéà(Q1 2022) New sound-system\r\nSoon we will allow server owners to fully configure any sound in this plugin.\r\nThis will also work with custom sounds from resource packs. Additionally you can change the pitch and volume of any sound or even mute it.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2844\r\n\r\n### üéà (Q1 2022) Changes to the radiation system\r\nThanks to @Semisol you will soon be able to enjoy a new radiation system which works by calculating a so-called \"exposure level\" to a radioactive substance. You won't experience radiation symptoms until a certain exposure level has been reached.\r\nThis will also make the different radiation levels much more distinct from each other and the features comes with a few good-looking UI changes too! You can track the progress of that here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3189\r\n\r\n### üéà (Q2 2022) SQL database support and Research system rewrite\r\nThe Research system will be rewritten api-wise.\r\nWe will also drop numeric ids for researches and solely rely on namespaced keys.\r\nIn addition to this, we will add support for SQL databases to sync researches across multiple servers.\r\nAlternatively, a local file-based database can be used.\r\n\r\n### üîß (Q2 2022) Recipe system rewrite\r\nOur recipe system is in deep need of a rewrite, it needs to be much less item-comparison based and we should allow alternate ingredients through the use of material tags or slimefun item classes and such.\r\nI will be doing this rewrite myself and some infrastructure has been set up already but nothing to show you yet, it is still a while until we get there.\r\n\r\n### üéà (Q3 2022) Programmable androids rewrite\r\nProgrammable androids are great.\r\nBut they can be better!

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain what you changed/added and why you did it in detail. -->\r\nThis pull request adds the `SoundService` and the `SoundEffect` enum which allow us to easily play sounds\r\nbut also allow server owners to easily configure and customize sounds.\r\nNote here that I opted for the minecraft-ids of sounds rather than the bukkit constants because this will allow\r\nserver owners to use completely custom sounds in combination with resource packs.\r\nIf a sound does not exist, the player will simply not hear anything, no error will be thrown.\r\n\r\nWhen values are misconfigured, a helpful warning will appear in the console.\r\nThis will also protect us against Mojang sound changes in the future, as we don't have to worry about the support of changed enum constants or such.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new config file:\r\n```yaml\r\nPORTABLE_CRAFTER_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.wolf.howl\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 0.123456789\r\nSPLINT_CONSUME_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.skeleton.hurt\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\nTRASH_CAN_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: i.dont.exist.btw.spinach.sucks.and.pineapple.on.pizza.rules\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ToDo (Why this is still a draft)\r\n* [x] MockBukkit does not support String-sounds atm, so Unit Tests will fail, I will need to update MockBukkit for that first\r\n* [ ] I would like to add Unit Tests for this sound service too\r\n* [ ] Not all sounds have been converted yet\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you should follow. -->\r\n<!-- You can click those check boxes after you posted your issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have fully tested the proposed changes and promise that they will not break everything into chaos.\r\n- [x] I have also tested the proposed changes in combination with various popular addons and can confirm my changes do not break them.\r\n- [x] I followed the existing code standards and didn't mess up the formatting.\r\n- [x] I did my best to add documentation to any public classes or methods I added.\r\n- [x] I have added `Nonnull` and `Nullable` annotations to my methods to indicate their behaviour for null values\r\n- [ ] I added sufficient Unit Tests to cover my code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835","id":814068423,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MTQwNjg0MjM=","number":2835,"title":"Default

Create a simple cargo setup consisting of one cargo manager, one cargo input node and one cargo output node\r\n2. Configure the cargo system in such way that it is transferring items into a slimefun managed inventory container, such as the \"Electric Furnace\"\r\n3. Destroy the Electric Furnace exactly after the TickerTask has processed Block removals and before it starts processing the tick of the cargo manager\r\n4. Observe how items are transferred into the destroyed Electric Furnace and are destroyed immediately afterwards as the TickerTask processes the removal of the Electric Furnace \r\n\r\nFrom my testing this is a very rare occasion, and as such a very hard bug to reproduce.\r\nHowever, with the help of a debugger which is capable of pausing the async TickerTask, it is reproducible every time\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe item does not transfer, or drops in the world\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n - Minecraft Version: v1_15_R1\r\n - Slimefun Version: DEV 489 (git d8964)\r\n - CS-CoreLib Version: v1.6.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","id":204901222,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ5MDEyMjI=","number":121,"title":"Cargo Input Nodes don't transfer whitelisted Items if not-whitelisted items come first","user":{"login":"BlackBeltPanda","id":5866087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjYwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5866087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda","html_url":"https://github.com/BlackBeltPanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"üêû Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-02-02T15:12:02Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T17:53:50Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Description\r\nWith an Input Node in Blacklist mode and no items blacklisted, connected to a chest with an Advanced Output Node with an item whitelisted, if any items are blocking the slots before the whitelisted item in the input chest with nowhere to go, the whitelisted item never gets transported.\r\n\r\n## Evidence / Proof\r\nGIF: https://i.gyazo.com/7199e6c7f7e7f173fa3c7f1dfa778efc.gif\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nMC version: 1.11.2 (git-Paper-1032)\r\nCS-CoreLib version: 1.5.12\r\nSlimefun version: 4.1.1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}]
